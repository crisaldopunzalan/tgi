		<h3>Expanding Horizon</h3>
		<p>The milestones achieved by our first company, Trends, is a testament to how impactful and well-received our humble beginnings have been. Now, we have multiple subsidiaries that operate independently of each other, with distinct business objectives and operational structure.</p>
		<p>When we are blessed with success, it is our duty to walk in wisdom and plan our course for making the best of it.</p>
		<p>Empowered by a strong vision, we are now ready to put in the work that comes with positioning our conglomerate to enter the world’s biggest economies.</p>
